Description
-----------

In this toolbox, we implemented a complete framework based on canonical
vine copulas for modelling multivariate data that are partly discrete and
partly continuous. The resulting multivariate distributions are flexible
with rich dependence structures and arbitrary margins. For continuous
margins, we provide implementations of the normal and the gamma
distributions. For discrete margins, we provide the Poisson, binomial and
negative binomial distributions. As bivariate copula building blocks, we
provide the Gaussian, student and Clayton families as well as rotation
transformed Clayton families. The toolbox includes methods for sampling,
likelihood calculation and inference, all of which have quadratic
complexity. These procedures are combined to estimate entropy and mutual
information by means of Monte Carlo integration.


Demonstration
-------------

The script `demo.m` demonstrates how to apply the Mixed Vine Toolbox. It
constructs a 4D mixed canonical vine with normal, gamma, Poisson and
binomial margins and builds the vine tree from Gaussian, Student, Clayton
and rotated Clayton copula families. It calculates and plots multivariate
marginal probability densities, samples from the distribution, estimates
the model from the samples and calculates entropy.
